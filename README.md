# Days to Hours Converter

A simple Python program that converts days into hours. The script takes user input for a number of days, validates the input, and displays the equivalent hours. The loop continues until the user types `"exit"`.

---

## 🧠 Features

- Accepts multiple day values separated by commas
- Validates input and handles:
  - Positive integers
  - Zero
  - Negative or invalid input
- Continuously prompts the user until `"exit"` is entered

---

## 💡 How It Works

- 1 day = 24 hours (conversion constant)
- You input a number like `5` and it returns:  
  `5 days are 120 hours`
- You can input multiple values like `3,5,0,-2,hello` and it will validate each
